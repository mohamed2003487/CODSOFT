# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - CodSoft Internship

This repository contains my **Titanic Survival Prediction** project, completed as part of the **CodSoft Internship (March 2025 - Batch B14)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not, based on given features such as age, fare, and cabin class.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy 📊
- Matplotlib 🎨
- Scikit-Learn 🤖
- Logistic Regression Model 📈

## 🔥 Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized survival distribution and key correlations.
3. **Model Training**: Used **Logistic Regression** to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Survival rates varied significantly based on **class and gender**.
- The **Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 82.68%**.
