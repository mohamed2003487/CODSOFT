# 📌 Credit Card Fraud Detection

🚀 This project builds a **Machine Learning Model** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Logistic Regression**.

## 🔥 Features
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Feature Engineering & Scaling
- 🔄 **Data Splitting**: Train/Test Split
- 🤖 **Model Training**: Logistic Regression
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Model Accuracy
- 🎨 **Visualization**: Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve

## 📊 Model Accuracy
✅ **Model Accuracy**: 0.9991222218320986 🎯

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of credit card transactions, where each transaction has:
- **Time**: The time elapsed between the first transaction and the current transaction.
- **V1 - V28**: 28 anonymized numerical features obtained from PCA transformation.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Class**: The target variable (0 = Genuine, 1 = Fraudulent).

The dataset is **highly imbalanced**, meaning fraudulent transactions are much rarer than genuine ones, requiring resampling techniques for better model performance.
