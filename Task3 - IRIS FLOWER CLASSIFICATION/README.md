# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into three species using a Decision Tree model. 🌿📊

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the well-known **Iris Dataset**, which consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each labeled as one of three species:
- 🌺 **Setosa**
- 🌼 **Versicolor**
- 🌻 **Virginica**

Each sample has four features:
- 🌱 **Sepal Length**
- 🌱 **Sepal Width**
- 🌿 **Petal Length**
- 🌿 **Petal Width**

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **📥 Load Dataset** - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **🔍 Data Exploration** - Displaying basic information, descriptive statistics, and checking for missing values.
3. **🛠️ Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature standardization.
4. **🎯 Feature Selection** - Selecting relevant features for model training.
5. **✂️ Train/Test Split** - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. **🧠 Model Training** - Training a Decision Tree Classifier.
7. **📊 Model Evaluation** - Evaluating the model using accuracy score and classification report.
8. **🌳 Decision Tree Visualization** - Visualizing the trained decision tree.

## 🔗 Dependencies
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🏗️ Pandas
- 🤖 Scikit-learn
- 📈 Matplotlib

## 🎯 Results
The Decision Tree model achieves high accuracy in classifying the Iris flower species. The tree structure is visualized using Matplotlib. 🌿📉
